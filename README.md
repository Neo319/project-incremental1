This is a simple project that demonstrates using plain JavaScript to create an incremental game based on clicking a button and acquiring various upgrades.

This project is :
- stateful
- object-oriented
- static
- minimalistic

Features: 
- 'Boop' and increment progress
- purchase 'booper' (current max = 10) to automate progress
- purchase upgrades to increase boops gained per click...

WIP: more features will be added over time. Enjoy!
